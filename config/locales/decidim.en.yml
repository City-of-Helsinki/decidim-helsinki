            <p>If you want to submit a proposal or comment on a proposal in the service, you must create a public
            profile. This means that other service users will see your user name attached to proposals or comments and
            can click on it to view your profile. Your public profile shows the following information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>your name</li>
              <li>your user name</li>
              <li>proposals and comments you have submitted</li>
              <li>who you follow and who follows you on OmaStadi</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, you can choose to add:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a profile photo</li>
              <li>a profile description</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can always change your profile back to non-public, so that none of your profile information is
            visible to other users. In this case, your user name will also be deleted from the proposals or comments
            you have submitted. You can change your profile to non-public on the site in your account privacy
            settings.</p>
